## Thesis-Related Notes  

### Spine  
I believe the printing shops near the university are far more professional than I am :smile:, and I’m not sure how they will use the spine you create.  

For those who still wish to create their own spine, please refer to the method used in the NTU version (`NTU_patch`).
